# CODEX Schema Concepts

## What is meant by "real world"?

CODEX schemas are not the result of a theoretical exercise. The *core* information elements which are the foundation of these schemas are derived from the data and events instrumented and emitted by ***REAL-WORLD*** systems and applications.

A detailed analysis of multiple vendors' solutions is completed in order to arrive at the types and IEs. As a result CODEX will simplify the integration of real-world environments than even so-called *standards-based* solutions.

## Information Element Tiers - The THREE C's

### Core

- Available (or can be derived) in >95% of implementations

### Common

- Available (or can be derived) in ~50% of implementations

### Custom

- Implemented by only a single of very few vendors (typically their â€œsecret sauce)

## Abbreviations

To reduce the size of information element and object names, abbreviations may be used. To ensure consistency, the following abbreviated terms are defined. Any IE or object names SHOULD only abbreviate these terms.
