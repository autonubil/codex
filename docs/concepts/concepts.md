# CODEX Schema Concepts

## What is meant by "real world"?

CODEX schemas are not the result of a theoretical exercise. The *core* information elements which are the foundation of these schemas are derived from the data and events instrumented and emitted by ***REAL-WORLD*** systems and applications.

A detailed analysis of multiple vendors' solutions is completed in order to arrive at the types and IEs. As a result CODEX will simplify the integration of real-world environments than even so-called *standards-based* solutions.

## The THREE C's

### Core

- Available (or can be derived) in >95% of implementations

### Common

- Available (or can be derived) in ~50% of implementations

### Custom

- Implemented by only a single of very few vendors (typically their â€œsecret sauce)
